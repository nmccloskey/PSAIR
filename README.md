# Infoscopy (Experimental)

**Status:** Early-stage, active development.  
**Stability:** APIs and module structure are subject to significant change.  
**Intended Audience:** Developers and researchers working with CLATR-derived tools or ELASTICAS.

Infoscopy is an experimental backend architecture intended to support structured data handling, exploratory data analysis, and scalable workflow orchestration across CLATR-style linguistic pipelines. At present, it functions as a staging environment for prototyping generalized utilities that may later integrate into ELASTICAS or a future unified system.

## Key Principles
- **Modularity:** Components are being designed to operate independently or as plug-ins to downstream analysis systems.
- **Generalization:** Infoscopy will evolve into a domain-agnostic backend for linguistic datasets.
- **Refactor-Friendly:** Expect reorganizations, renamings, and experimental interfaces.

## Current State
Infoscopy is **not** ready for field use.  
Documentation will expand once the core architecture stabilizes.  
Issues and pull requests are welcome, but major revisions are expected.
